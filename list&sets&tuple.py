# List []
# Ordered: Elements have a specific order, and this order is maintained.
#
# Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or changed.
#
# Allows Duplicates: Elements can appear more than once.
#
# Indexable: Elements can be accessed by their index.

# Set {}
# Unordered: Elements have no specific order.
#
# Mutable: Elements can be added or removed.
#
# No Duplicates: Each element is unique.
#
# Not Indexable: Elements cannot be accessed by index.
#
# Tuple ()
# Ordered: Elements have a specific order.
#
# Immutable: Elements cannot be changed after the tuple is created.
#
# Allows Duplicates: Elements can appear more than once.
#
# Indexable: Elements can be accessed by their index.

# remove
